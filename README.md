🤖 AI Course Project Repository

Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence course project repository. This contains implementations of various AI algorithms, AI-based games, and explorations using AI tools.

🧭 Purpose of the Course

The primary objective of this course was to introduce students to fundamental concepts of Artificial Intelligence including:

Intelligent search strategies

Game theory

Problem solving

Application of AI tools in real-world contexts

📚 What I Learned

Throughout this course, I have learned and implemented the following:

✅ Classical Search Algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*, Iterative Deepening, etc.)

✅ AI-based Game Development (e.g., Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning)

✅ AI Tool Usage (e.g., AI-generated videos & presentations)

✅ Problem-solving through logic, heuristics, and optimization

⏳ Course Duration

January 2025 – June 2025(Approx. 6 months)
