# Tic Tac Toe: User vs AI 🎮🤖

## Description
This is a simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game where you play against an AI opponent. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, providing a challenging experience. 🧠✨

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the project files. 📥
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari). 🌐
3. The game will load and be ready to play. ▶️

## Pre-requisites
- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled. 🖥️
- No additional software, libraries, or frameworks are required. ✅

## How to Play
- The game board consists of a 3x3 grid. 🔲
- You play as "O" and the AI plays as "X". ❌⭕
- Click on any empty cell to place your move. 🖱️
- The AI will automatically make its move after yours. 🤖
- The game status (win, lose, or tie) will be displayed below the board. 📢
- Click the "Restart" button to reset the game and play again. 🔄

## Algorithm Used
The AI opponent uses the **Minimax algorithm**, a recursive decision-making algorithm used in game theory and AI to find the optimal move. It evaluates all possible moves and their outcomes to choose the best possible move, ensuring the AI never loses. 🧩♟️
